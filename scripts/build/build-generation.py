    """A supervision binding is named for the task it supervises.

    The `minted:` resolve axis lets a component ask the root which of its slots
    holds a named binding, which is only usable if the name means the same thing
    in every generation that declares it. Three conventions were in the fixtures
    at once — `fabric-publisher-supervision`,
    `fabric-service-supervision-publisher`, and
    `fabric-service-call-client-supervision` — so a component could not ask by
    name without a manifest-specific alias table, which is exactly the
    compile-time coupling B70 exists to remove. Naming the handle for the
    *supervised* task is the one choice that is a property of the graph rather
    than of which manifest happens to declare it: `fabric-service` and
    `fabric-call-worker` both supervise `fabric-call-client`, and under this rule
    both name that handle `fabric-call-client-supervision`.

    Asserted here rather than merely applied, so a fourth convention is a build
    failure rather than a name a component silently cannot resolve. Scoped to
    `supervision`, the one kind whose object is a task identity; other minted
    kinds name channels and have no supervised instance to be named for.

    Instance names may be prefixes of one another — `fabric-op-client-b` and
    `fabric-op-client-b-restart` both exist, each with its own handle — so the
    check strips the suffix and looks up the whole remainder, rather than
    searching for a known instance name inside the string. A substring search
    would resolve `fabric-op-client-b-restart-supervision` to the wrong task.

    The owner clause is what makes the name *answerable*. `resolve_minted_slot`
    scopes to the calling holder, so the name only has to be unique per holder —
    but a handle can only exist if its minter owns the task it names, which the
    holder-ownership check below already requires of the holder. Requiring the
    supervised instance to be owned by the same minter keeps the two halves
    consistent: a name pointing at a task its minter cannot supervise would pass
    the string check and fail at spawn.
