"""CP1 system-specification compiler and generation derivation.

Decodes `contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/*.zti`, validates it against the
component specs it references, and derives a `contracts/generation-manifest/v1`
`GenerationManifest` from the pair.

The derivation is the point of the milestone, so what it derives rather than
copies is worth stating plainly. Derived:

  - `executables`  — one per referenced component spec: `role` from
    `componentType`, `spawnBudget` and `stackBytes` from `runtime.resource`,
    `commandProfile` from the system's command bindings.
  - `instances`    — `executable`, `health`, and `dependencies` from the
    component spec; `owner` and the thread/priority fields from the system's
    placement; and every `bindings` entry from the grant table, since a grant
    materializes in whichever instance holds it.
  - `objects`      — one per component plus the resource objects the presence of
    a budget or a fabric graph implies.
  - `sharedBufferBudget` — from each component spec's `runtime.resource`.
  - `health.requiredInstances` — the components whose spec says `required`.

Declared, because no component spec can know it: the grant table (authority
between components is a property of the composition), the notification objects,
the fabric graph, the boot profiles, and the persisted state bindings.

Slot numbers are ordinarily assigned by `build-generation.py`'s own
`assign_declared_slots`, which is a function of the manifest alone. A system may
pin individual slots, and does for `valid.zti`, whose numbers
`contracts/boot-layout/v1/fixtures/*.layout` freeze byte for byte.

# converts every composition whose instances map one-to-one onto a component
# spec name — no shared executable spawned under more than one instance name,
# and no per-instance dependency naming another instance of the same
# executable. The 17 remaining compositions need that generalization (a
# concrete instance distinct from the component/executable it runs, with
# composition-declared per-instance dependencies) before they can convert; see
# `roadmap/00-backlog.md`. `sel4-c-runtime` and `sel4-filesystem` fit the
# one-to-one shape but are deferred too: the former's implementation is a
# freestanding C source with no stable committed content identity, and the
# latter's executable name (`sel4-filesystem-service`) collides with the
# unrelated pre-existing `filesystem-service` component spec's implementation
# binary. An explicit table rather than a glob, so "which fixtures are
# generated" is a stated fact and a system spec that derives nothing is a gate
# failure rather than a silent no-op. Both the gate and the generator read it

    #   - kind containment: `init` holds an `endpoint` kind under the channel
