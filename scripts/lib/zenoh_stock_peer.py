"""Bytes a stock eclipse-zenoh 1.0.0 peer put on a TCP link, captured once.

These are the batch bodies (without the 2-byte stream length) that a real Zenoh peer sent
to, and accepted from, an endpoint running this repository's Profile 0 encoder. They are
the independent bytes the stock-peer exam judges against: this repository did not write
them, and no Slime code produced the stock side of any batch.

Provenance, all on one x86_64 Linux host, one run each:

* peer: `eclipse-zenoh==1.0.0` Python wheel
  `eclipse_zenoh-1.0.0-cp38-abi3-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl`,
  sha256 `1763912951ecd2a3706f668faf0541245387096b37a4fefb73af7848dadd46ff`, `mode=peer`,
  multicast scouting and gossip disabled, one TCP endpoint, loopback.
* our side: the Profile 0 encoder at `65244f8d` (`INIT_ACK`/`OPEN_ACK` as listener, `INIT_SYN`/
  `OPEN_SYN` and `Put` frames as connector), answering and publishing the demo key and the
  four demo samples with their 33-byte attachments. Our side's batches are not fixtures.
* `connects`: the stock peer connected to us, declared a subscriber and a publisher on the
  demo key, and published the four samples with attachments. We listened.
* `listens`: the stock peer listened with a subscriber on the demo key. We connected, waited
  for its subscriber declaration, and published the four samples.
* `refuse`: batches a stock peer sent that a bounded profile must keep refusing: a client and
  a router `INIT_SYN`, a queryable declaration, a `get` request, a wildcard key declaration,
  and a wildcard declared as a suffix of a declared alias. Six more are built from captured
  batches (and, for the last, an accepted corpus row) by `wrong_position_qos`: the QoS extension the peer sends on an OAM or declaration,
  added to a FRAME header, a PUSH, a Put, the inner header of a subscriber declaration, a
  DeclareFinal and an UndeclareSubscriber, where it was never seen. (The captured QoS sits on
  the outer DECLARE, `9e 21 08`, that wraps a DeclareKeyExpr or DeclareSubscriber; the inner
  declaration header is a different position.)

Fields that vary between runs are the Zenoh IDs, the frame sequence numbers, the cookie and
the initial sequence number. The batches replay as bytes, so a run is deterministic.

What this does not cover: `rmw_zenoh` itself, liveliness tokens (the 1.0.0 Python binding has
no liveliness API, so none was observed), a router actually forwarding, and any peer other
than this one. See docs/decisions/zenoh-stock-peer.md.
