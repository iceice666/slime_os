"""The fragment ids a Markdown file's links may name, over a declared subset.

An inbound `…#fragment` link is an address. Rewording a heading changes that
address while leaving the file in place, so the failure has no symptom at the
destination — which is why `check-devlog.py` validates fragments rather than
stripping them, and why this computation lives in one tested place.

Scope, stated exactly rather than as "GitHub's rules":

* **Headings** are ATX (`#`–`######`) outside fenced code. A fence's contents
  are literal text and produce no heading, so a documentation example showing
  `## Removed heading` must not manufacture that anchor.
* **Slugs** lowercase the heading, drop its Markdown syntax, delete punctuation
  that is not a word character or hyphen, and join words with hyphens. Inline
  code contributes its *literal* text: `` `release_trust_check` `` keeps its
  underscores, because they are code, not emphasis.
* **Duplicates** take an incrementing suffix in document order — the second
  `## Verification` is `#verification-1`. 39 slugs repeat in this repository's
  roadmap files, so this is load-bearing rather than hypothetical.
* **Explicit anchors** are `<a id="…">` and `<a name="…">`, used to retain an
  address a heading no longer produces.

Deliberately outside scope: Setext headings (`===`/`---` underlines), which this
repository does not use; HTML `<h1>`–`<h6>` elements; and heading text spanning
multiple lines. Each would be silent under-approximation, so `controls()` pins
the supported set as executable cases.
