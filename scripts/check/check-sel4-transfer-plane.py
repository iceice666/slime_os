"""P5.4.3 gate: M6.7's generation transfer (M6.7).

A generation crosses a persistence boundary. Two devices are attached: a
*source* the component may only read, carrying the transfer manifest, and a
*receiver* it may write, holding the BootState.

The separation is the milestone. M6.7 requires that a transfer "leave every
ungranted device byte-identical", and here the source is granted — read-only —
so the claim is sharper: a device granted `blockRead` alone is byte-identical
even though the component reached it, repeatedly, and wanted to write it.

The arms:

* the source refuses a write, checked before anything else;
* the manifest decodes, which validates bounds, ordering, and a self-excluding
  SHA-256 over the whole record;
* a tampered byte fails that digest specifically, not some field it landed in;
* the object closure re-hashes to the identities the manifest declares, before
  any BootState write — so an incomplete transfer costs the receiver nothing;
* state travels only where the source declared it may;
* the generation stages **pending**, leaving the known-good root intact, and
  only health confirmation promotes it.

This plane exists because B29 was fixed: two QEMU virtio transports share one
4 KiB granule, and the root now maps that granule once and hands each driver a
borrowed view at its own offset.
