    C8.15's split, applied here — and after review the split falls in a different
    place than it first did. Both *typed outputs* are compared across boots, which
    is what C9.5's first required check demands: "byte-identical typed outputs
    across two boots". An earlier revision excluded `elapsed` because it derived
    from two hardware instants, which no two boots share — but excluding a typed
    output from the very comparison the milestone names is answering a weaker
    question. The plane was changed instead: the outputs now derive from the
    *simulated* clock, which moves only when its declared advancer moves it, so
    their byte identity is a real property of the composition rather than a hope
    about QEMU's cycle counts.

    What stays excluded is the recorded monotonic instant itself, and it is
    excluded because it is not an output. It is an *input* the recording carries
    to prove the replay could not have obtained it, and `check_semantics`
    range-checks it per boot. A hardware counter reading the same value twice
