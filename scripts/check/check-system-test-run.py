"""Gate `contracts/system-test-run/v1`: execution inputs are declared, bounded, and typed.

CP11's boundary is that a marker oracle, a timeout, a disk fixture, or an
injected device event cannot alter the image closure it exercises. That
separation is only real if both halves are checked: the closure side by
`just system_image_closure_check`, and this side here.

What this asserts:

1. every plane gate that boots a seL4 QEMU image has a record, and every record
   names a plane gate — neither set may contain a name the other lacks;
2. each record decodes through the generated contract binding, so the bounds and
   closed vocabularies the schema declares are enforced rather than assumed;
3. a record naming a closure resolves it, and a record naming none corresponds
   to an image the aggregate gate independently agrees is closure-exempt — so an
   empty identity is a checked statement rather than a blank field;
4. every declared timeout is positive and within the contract's ceiling, and
   every fault kind and execution kind is from the closed vocabulary;
5. the records agree with the checkers they were extracted from, which is what
   makes them a freeze rather than a snapshot that silently rots.

The records are declarations, not yet the execution path: the checkers still run
from their own constants, and CP15's migration is what makes these the input. The
freeze is what that migration will be verified against.
