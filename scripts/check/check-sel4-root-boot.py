    What must hold is that it never moves: native component images link at fixed
    virtual addresses and hold real machine pointers, so a growth that relocated
    the base would invalidate every one of them.

    Checked here rather than by a backreference in `REQUIRED_MARKERS`, because
    each of those patterns is compiled separately and a group in one cannot be
    referenced from another.

    Three sets are collected, and the third is what makes this more than a
    consistency check on printed numbers: the root's record of what it mapped,
    the base the child was *answered*, and the base the child actually
    *dereferenced* for its zero read and its pattern readback. Without the
    third, a root that answered one address while mapping another would produce
