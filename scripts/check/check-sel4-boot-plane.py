"""P5.4.9/C8.10 gate: the full C8 graph in one seL4 generation.

The x86 gate (``just data_fabric_boot_check``) proves that every C8 role can
coexist in one boot. This gate boots the ``sel4-boot`` image and proves the same
of ``slime-root``: one generation, all three planes at once, in disjoint slots
with no profile-dependent rewrite, every participant reaching a checked role or
a declared role-less idle, and the supervisor certifying the complete graph.

The healthy record is necessary evidence but not a stopping point (B55): it
fires the instant every declared instance exists as a live task, which is
causally *before* the twenty instances' own provisioning traffic — the record
is printed from the same central dispatch loop that also services every
task's IPC, and the last spawn returning is what satisfies it. Capture
continues until the transcript has gone quiet after the healthy record, which
is the declared end state (every task blocked idle, nothing left to say), and
any component exit anywhere in that window — before or after the healthy
record — poisons the transcript.
