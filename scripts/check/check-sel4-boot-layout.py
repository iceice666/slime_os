"""B10 on seL4: init's resolved capability layout, per plane, against fixtures.

The boot layout is a contract between three readers -- the root task that fills
init's capability table, the component images that address slots by number, and
the gates that assert on what those components do. Nothing else fails when the
three disagree: a component reads whatever landed at the number it compiled
against, and the symptom surfaces as unrelated behaviour somewhere downstream.

`just boot_layout_check` freezes that layout for nineteen x86 profiles by
booting the retired kernel and diffing its `[layout]` block against a recorded
fixture. No seL4 equivalent existed. P5.4.1's inventory recorded B10 as covered
only *obliquely* on this side -- three gates assert specific slot numbers in
passing (`slot=0 kind=endpoint-factory`, `slot=4 component=sysinfo`) -- which
catches a layout that moved *those* slots and nothing else.

This gate closes that. `slime-root` now emits the same `[layout]` block the
oracle does, and every seL4 plane's is frozen here, so a layout change is a
reviewable diff rather than a silent renumbering.

# Why every plane rather than one

Each plane boots a different generation, and `layout_for` prunes the base table
by which components that generation declares. The pruning is the interesting
part -- it renumbers -- so freezing one plane would leave every other
composition unguarded against exactly the change most likely to break it.

# Relationship to the boot itself

This is a *layout* gate, not a behaviour one: it boots each image and reads one
block. The planes' own gates assert what their components do. Kept separate for
the reason `boot_layout_check` is separate on x86 -- a layout diff should be
readable as a layout diff, not inferred from a component failing.

Regenerate with `--bless`; the resulting diff is the evidence that a layout
change was intended.
