"""Reject privileged x86 mechanism in surviving neutral Rust trees.

P1 extracted the retired custom kernel's x86 mechanism behind an explicit
boundary and this gate keeps it there. What it forbids is *privileged
mechanism*: raw general-purpose and control registers, ring-0 instructions,
relocation and ELF-magic constants, and the emulator binary. The
architecture-neutral trees below reach hardware only through seL4
invocations, so none of those may appear in them.

The architecture *name* is not itself forbidden, for the same reason
`aarch64` and `riscv64` are not: these trees already select per-architecture
arms with `#[cfg(target_arch = ...)]`, and P6.1 makes `x86_64` an admitted
seL4 architecture alongside them. A `cfg` arm is the boundary working, not a
breach of it. What would be a breach — an inline `mov %cr4`, a `wrmsr`, a
hard-coded `R_X86_64_*` relocation — is still refused, and P6's own source
boundary (`roadmap/07-architecture-portability.md`) keeps privileged x86
mechanism outside these trees.
