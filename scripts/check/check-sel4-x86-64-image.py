"""P6.1: the admitted, reproducible x86-64 seL4 build, without a boot claim.

Deliberately not a QEMU check. P6.1's exit condition is that the repository
reproducibly builds an *admitted* x86-64 seL4 kernel, root task, child fixture,
and generation for one pinned pc99 profile; booting them is P6.2's, and this
platform has no packaged image to boot because it is on seL4's native
Multiboot2 route.

Three things are asserted:

  * the built artifacts really are x86-64 and really carry the pc99 profile's
    exact qualification;
  * a wrong architecture, ABI, page profile, machine, or profile identity is
    refused before any executable byte is mapped;
  * two normalized builds produce byte-identical kernel, root, child,
    generation, and identity artifacts, and the AArch64 and RV64 profiles keep
    their own identities.

Run `scripts/build/build-sel4.py --platform qemu-pc99` first; this reads what
that produced rather than rebuilding it, except for the reproducibility case,
which rebuilds deliberately.
