# Task-to-file index

Where a change starts, and which files follow. This is the routing table
`AGENTS.md` points at: find your change's row, read the named module root
first, then use LSP symbols or references from there, and only then grep the
exact symbol. Do not scan `deps/`, `target/`, `roadmap/`, or `.tasks/` for
implementation symbols unless the task specifically concerns them.

The [recipes](getting-started/11-recipes.md) page turns the most common rows
into step-by-step checklists; the [glossary](glossary.md) explains the terms.
Keep this table in the same commit as any move of an owning module.

| Change | Canonical starting point | Follow-on files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability kinds, rights, derivation, transfer | `slime-root/src/generation.rs` | `slime-root/src/{graph,ipc}.rs`; grants are declared in the system spec below |
| Native endpoint IPC, message bounds, endpoint lifetime | `slime-root/src/peer_endpoint.rs` | `slime-root/src/{ipc,notification}.rs`, `components/runtime/src/syscall/sel4_transport.rs` |
| Tasks, spawn, supervision, termination, reclamation | `slime-root/src/task.rs` | `slime-root/src/{main,child_vspace,fault,supervision}.rs` |
| Syscall argument validation and rights gates | `slime-root/src/ipc.rs` | owner modules in `slime-root/src/`, wrappers in `components/runtime/src/syscall.rs` |
| seL4 object allocation and VSpace construction | `slime-root/src/object_allocator.rs` | `slime-root/src/{child_vspace,buffer_adapter}.rs` |
| Shared-buffer allocation, mapping, loan, accounting | `slime-root/src/shared_buffer.rs` | `slime-root/src/{buffer_adapter,transfer_window,ipc}.rs` |
| Boot graph and component launch grants | `slime-root/src/main.rs` | generation decoding in `slime-root/src/generation.rs`, system specs below |
| Generation decoding and identity | `boot-contracts/src/generation.rs` | admission in `slime-root/src/generation.rs` |
| Composition: which components run, grants, slots, budgets, health | `contracts/system-spec/v1/sources/<name>.zt` for `COMPUTED_SYSTEM_SOURCES`, otherwise `contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/<name>.zti` | authoring ownership: `contracts/system-spec/README.md`; derivation map `DERIVED_GENERATION_FIXTURES` in `scripts/lib/system_spec.py`; regenerate with `python3 scripts/generate/generate-generation-from-spec.py`; `just system_spec_check` refuses drift. `contracts/generation-manifest/v1/{compositions,fixtures}/*.zti` are derived outputs |
| Generation construction and manifest encoding | `scripts/build/build-generation.py` | `contracts/generation-manifest/v1/schema.zt`, `components/build-support/src/lib.rs` |
| System-image closure: the build key every `sel4_*` gate resolves before booting | `scripts/generate/generate-system-image-closures.py` | `contracts/system-image-closure/v2/{closures,negative}/*.zti` are derived outputs recording a tree digest of `slime-root`, `boot-contracts`, `components/{lib,proto,runtime,build-support}`, each closed-over component crate, `just`, `Cargo.{toml,lock}`, `contracts/{component-spec,interface-schema}`, and `deps/rust-sel4`; each rendered system-spec `.zti` is separately bound as a file, not its authoring-source tree. After editing any of those, rerun the generator and commit the closures with the change, or every plane gate refuses with `closure does not resolve: … identity mismatch`.

| Protocol validation regression | `components/proto/tests/<protocol>.rs` | generated protocol module and schema |
| Adding a component | new `components/{system,services,applications,testkit}/<name>/` crate | the matching `Cargo.toml` workspace member glob plus its `[profile.release.package]` stanza, a `contracts/component-spec/v1/components/` record, and a `contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/` entry with its regenerated manifest; `just component_crate_split_check` gates the shape. [`docs/getting-started/05-add-a-component.md`](getting-started/05-add-a-component.md) walks it end to end |

## Where policy and mechanism live

- Mechanism (allocation, IPC, supervision, admission) is `slime-root`; component
  policy (who spawns what, with which grants) is userspace and the system spec.
- Generated files — anything beginning `@generated`, `boot-contracts/src/generated/`,
  every derived manifest in `DERIVED_GENERATION_FIXTURES`, the computed system
  specs in `COMPUTED_SYSTEM_SOURCES`, and every closure under
  `contracts/system-image-closure/v2/` — are outputs. Edit the schema or
  authoring source and regenerate; `AGENTS.md` states the rule and the
  regeneration commands.
- `scripts/check/` is verification code, never the implementation of the
  behavior it checks; the shared plane mechanism is `scripts/lib/`.
