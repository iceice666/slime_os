# 19. MPK/PKU lightweight compartments

| Enables | a third isolation tier between full components and same-address-space code |

## Motivation

A third isolation tier between full components and same-address-space
code for latency-sensitive boundaries, using user-space protection keys
available on the target CPU. Full component isolation costs address
spaces and context switches; some boundaries (a hot parser, a codec, an
in-process plugin) want memory protection without that cost. PKU gives
page-granularity write/execute disablement switchable from userspace —
cheap enough for per-call boundaries.

## Design sketch

A compartment shares its owner's address space but holds a distinct
protection key; data pages are tagged so that exactly one compartment's
key permits access at a time, and crossing the boundary is a
key-switching call gate rather than an IPC. The authority question:
does a compartment hold its own capability set (a lightweight principal)
or operate strictly under its owner's grants with memory isolation as
the only separation? The latter preserves the current model — one
capability table entry per component — and is the conservative reading;
the former makes compartments first-class principals with matrix
consequences.

Fault semantics must match the component model's discipline: a PKU
violation in one compartment is reported as a structured fault without
terminating the other — the register's exit condition — so the fault
classification vocabulary (M5.6's exit/fault/timeout distinction)
extends rather than forks.

The entry's real design output is admission criteria: which boundaries
may use PKU (latency-critical, same trust domain, no independent
rollback of state) and which must remain full components (independent
authority, independent failure domain in the generation graph).

## Open questions

- Are compartments separate principals (own capabilities) or memory
  domains under their owner's grants?
- Who may switch keys — is the call gate a kernel-mediated operation
  or pure userspace (with what confused-deputy exposure)?
- How does a compartment fault interact with supervision
  ([entry 8](08-declarative-supervision.md)) — restart the owner
  component, or the compartment alone?
- State: may a compartment hold `preserve`d state bindings, or is all
  durable state the owner's?
