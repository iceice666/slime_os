# Build and run

Goal: from a fresh clone to a booted Slime OS image under QEMU, plus the
verification aggregate that proves the boot you saw is the boot the repository
promises.

Everything below runs on the automated product target
`aarch64-sel4-qemu-virt`. No physical hardware is required.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Clone with submodules

The seL4 kernel, rust-sel4 crates, and Zutai are pinned Git submodules under
`deps/`. The Slisp product component is built directly from the in-tree
freestanding C sources.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/iceice666/slime_os.git
# or, for an existing checkout:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Enter the dev shell

The supported environment is the Nix dev shell:

```sh
nix develop
```

It provides everything the build needs — `just`, QEMU, CMake, Ninja, `dtc`,
the exact GNU AArch64 cross compiler the pinned kernel hashes were observed
with (exported as `CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX`), a Python with the seL4 kernel
generators' modules, and `rustup`. On first entry its hook installs the two
pinned Rust toolchains:

- the workspace toolchain (declared in `flake.nix`), used by host crates and
  components;
- the rust-sel4 toolchain (declared in `sel4/pins.toml [rust_sel4]`), used to
  build the root task, its child, and the kernel loader.

Working outside the shell is possible but unsupported: you would have to
reproduce each of those pins by hand, and the pin check will still hold you
to them.

Supported host systems are the ones `flake.nix` declares: `x86_64-linux`,
`aarch64-linux`, and `aarch64-darwin`.

## First boot

```sh
just run
```

This chains three steps:

1. **`just sel4_pin_check`** — verifies every pin the product depends on:
   submodule commits and origins, the seL4 release, both Rust toolchains, the
   root target spec bytes, and the kernel configuration against
   `sel4/pins.toml`. It fetches and installs nothing; it only refuses.
2. **`scripts/build/build-sel4.py`** — configures, builds, and installs the
   pinned seL4 kernel into `build/sel4-prefix/`, builds the root task with the
   product generation embedded, builds the kernel loader, and packages
   `build/slime-sel4-graph.elf`. It also writes
   `build/slime-sel4.identity.json` recording source, config, ELF, and image
   digests. The first build compiles the kernel and every component crate, so
   it takes a while; later builds are incremental.
3. **QEMU** — boots the image on the pinned machine
   (`virt,virtualization=on`, cortex-a53, 1 CPU, 2048 MiB) with serial on
   stdio.

You will see the elfloader, then seL4's boot output, then the root task's
ordered `SLIME_ROOT` / `SLIME_GRAPH` markers as it admits the generation and
launches the component graph — see the
[boot walkthrough](03-boot-walkthrough.md) for what each stage means. The
graph runs to completion and comes to rest; QEMU does not exit on its own.
Quit with `Ctrl-A x`.

## Verify

```sh
just test
```

The product behavioral aggregate: it boots the root-fixture image and the
component-graph image and asserts their ordered serial markers, then proves
the marker assertions themselves fail on missing, reordered, or
explicitly-failing evidence (`sel4_gate_control_check`).

Beyond the aggregate, each subsystem has its own narrow QEMU gate
(`just --list` shows all of them; `AGENTS.md` names the canonical one per
change area). The ones you will meet first:

```sh
just test_sel4_root      # slime-root's host unit tests (needs the built seL4 prefix)
just test_host           # host unit tests for boot-contracts and slime-proto
just contracts_check     # every Zutai contract and generated binding
just fmt_check_all       # formatting, all workspace crates
just lint_all            # clippy, warnings denied
```

## Common failures

**`missing pin manifest` / `unresolved import` / empty `deps/sel4`** —
submodules are not initialized. Run
`git submodule update --init --recursive`.

**`required tool is not on PATH: ...gcc`** — you are outside `nix develop`,
or entered it before the shell finished its hook. The build takes the cross
compiler from `CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX`, which the shell exports as an absolute
store path.

**`the seL4 build's host Python generators are missing modules ...`** — the
kernel's own build drives Python generators through a bare `python3`; only
the dev shell's Python carries their dependencies. Enter `nix develop`.

**`sel4_pin_check` reports toolchain drift** — the built kernel's hashes no
longer match `sel4/pins.toml [observed_prefix]`. If you did not intentionally
change the kernel, config, or toolchain, suspect a moved `flake.nix` input
(the pins file's comments explain exactly what the hashes bind). Do not bless
new hashes to make the error go away; the mismatch is the finding.

**`test_sel4_root` / `lint_sel4_root` refuses to run** — both need the
installed seL4 prefix (`build/sel4-prefix/`), because the `sel4` crate reads
libsel4's generated config at build time. Run `just run` or
`just sel4_qemu_image_check` once first. Refusal is deliberate: silently
linting or testing a different configuration would be worse than failing.

**A `sel4_*_check` gate hangs or times out** — the gates boot real QEMU
processes and wait for ordered markers; a missing marker means the behavior
regressed, not that the gate is flaky. Read the transcript the failing gate
prints, and compare against the marker table in its
`scripts/check/check-sel4-*.py`.

## Where things land

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `build/sel4-prefix/` | the installed seL4 kernel, libsel4, and platform info |
| `build/sel4-cargo/` | cargo target directories for the seL4-target crates |
| `build/slime-sel4-graph.elf` | the packaged product image `just run` boots |
| `build/slime-sel4.identity.json` | digests tying the image to its sources |

`build/` is disposable; deleting it costs you one full rebuild.
