# Add a component

A buildable crate is not a running component. A component reaches QEMU only
when all five layers agree:

1. **Implementation** — one buildable component crate.
2. **Declaration** — one component specification describing what that component
   is and what it requires.
3. **Composition** — one generation includes an executable and an instance.
4. **Authority and launch policy** — the actual spawner can launch it, and the
   instance receives only its declared grants and bindings.
5. **Observed behavior** — the owning QEMU gate sees admission, launch, the
   component's marker, its intended terminal or healthy-idle state, and the
   final health census.

A crate or catalogue entry never launches itself. Keep that invariant in view
through every step below.

For the smallest current in-tree pattern, read the
[`sysinfo` crate](../../components/bins/sysinfo/) beside its
[component specification](../../contracts/component-spec/v1/components/sysinfo.zti).
`sysinfo` is a leaf application with no capability requirements and no private
resource budget. The `hello` snippets below copy that crate shape without
adding its launch-context behavior.

## Choose the layer you are changing

| You are adding | Source to change | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buildable in-tree code | `components/bins/<name>/` | Cargo can produce a component ELF. Nothing runs yet. |
| A component declaration | `contracts/component-spec/v1/components/<name>.zti` | The repository can validate the component's identity, requirements, compatibility, and evidence. Nothing runs yet. |
| A system-spec-derived composition | [`contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/*.zti`](../../contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/) | A system spec selects components, placement, authority, budgets, and graph records from which a generation fixture is derived. |
| A direct seL4 plane composition | [`contracts/generation-manifest/v1/compositions/sel4-*.zti`](../../contracts/generation-manifest/v1/compositions/) | The owning seL4 composition directly declares its executable, instance, authority, and policy. |

The current derivation boundary is deliberately narrow:

- `contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/reference.zti` derives
  `contracts/generation-manifest/v1/fixtures/valid.zti`.
- `contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/sel4-channel.zti` derives
  `contracts/generation-manifest/v1/compositions/sel4-channel.zti`.
- The default product builder still reads
  `contracts/generation-manifest/v1/compositions/sel4.zti` directly.

Therefore, editing `reference.zti` alone does **not** change `just run`. Before
editing a composition, determine whether its fixture is system-spec-derived or
directly owned. Do not hand-edit a derived fixture.

## 1. Add the implementation crate

Create this minimum layout:

```text
components/bins/hello/
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.rs
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

`components/bins/*` is already a workspace-member glob, so no new entry is
needed in `[workspace].members`.

### `components/bins/hello/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[package]
name = "slime-component-hello"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
publish = false
rust-version = "1.96"
build = "build.rs"

[[bin]]
name = "hello"
path = "src/main.rs"
test = false

[dependencies]
slime-rt = { path = "../../runtime" }

[build-dependencies]
slime-build-support = { path = "../../build-support" }

[lints]
workspace = true
```

### `components/bins/hello/build.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    slime_build_support::configure();
}
```

The build script configures the shared component build environment. It must not
parse a generation, copy private per-plane data, or derive capability slots.

### `components/bins/hello/src/main.rs`

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

slime_rt::entry!(main);

fn main(_startup_arg: u32) {
    slime_rt::debug_write(b"[hello] running\n");
}
```

The marker is behavioral contract surface once a QEMU gate asserts it. Change
the emitting code and that gate's ordered marker table together.

### Add the release profile

Cargo has no package glob that applies these settings to workspace members.
A real component addition must add this exact root `Cargo.toml` stanza:

```toml
[profile.release.package.slime-component-hello]
opt-level = "s"
codegen-units = 1
debug = false
```

The size settings are load-bearing because `slime-root` maps a component image
whole.

`just component_crate_split_check` enforces the crate boundary:

- directory `hello`, package `slime-component-hello`, and binary `hello` agree;
- the crate declares exactly one binary and `build = "build.rs"`;
- `build.rs` does nothing except call `slime_build_support::configure()`;
- allocator features remain scoped to the component groups that require them;
- the root release-profile stanza exists with the exact settings above; and
- shared source lives in `components/lib`, not beside the component crates.

Do not enable an allocator for an authority-free leaf component. If two
components need the same source, move that source to `components/lib` instead
of creating a second shared-code location.

## 2. Declare the component

Add `contracts/component-spec/v1/components/hello.zti`, but do not invent the
record from an empty template. Copy the nearest **admitted** component spec and
replace every semantic field. For this leaf shape,
[`sysinfo.zti`](../../contracts/component-spec/v1/components/sysinfo.zti) is the
starting point.

A component spec describes the component independently of any one composition.
Its field groups require deliberate choices:

- **Identity and implementation:** choose `name`, `componentType`, version,
  purpose, and owner; for this crate use `implementation.provider =
  "workspace"`, `implementation.binary = "hello"`, and an empty
  `contentHash`.
- **Capability kinds:** `provides` and `requires` summarize the authority the
  reference generation actually gives the component. Start empty for this leaf
  example. Add a kind only when the composition contains the corresponding
  grant; never use these lists as a wish list.
- **Interfaces and communication:** leave interfaces and QoS empty when the
  component has no IPC or fabric role. A real interface is a versioned Zutai
  schema under `contracts/`, followed by generated bindings and matching
  composition records — not a Rust-only wire struct or a second schema language.
- **Lifecycle:** select the admitted states in canonical order. A simple leaf
  follows the nearest comparable component; service readiness, degradation, or
  stop behavior must be reflected rather than assumed.
- **Resources:** declare the stack and every bounded resource. Spawn budget,
  extra threads, shared-buffer pages/count/mappings/loans, and private-page
  quota stay zero unless observed behavior requires them.
- **Health:** choose `required` or `optional` consistently with the composed
  instance and health census. A component is not required merely because it is
  useful.
- **Compatibility:** keep the platform equal to the execution environment and
  select modes derived from the component's real dependencies, resources,
  runtime, interfaces, and QoS.
- **Evidence:** `test.requiredTestEnvironment` must name a real Justfile target,
  and `test.passFailCriteria` must be an exact string literal asserted by that
  gate's check script.

Do **not** copy a fictitious `hello.zti` with a made-up gate. First choose and
extend the real QEMU gate that owns the new behavior; then make the spec point
to that target and one of its actual evidence markers. `just
component_spec_check` validates both the record and this evidence link.

## 3. Compose an executable and an instance

The declaration says what `hello` is. A composition says that one instance of
it exists in one generation, who owns it, how it starts, what it may access,
and how the graph accounts for it.

### Path A: system-spec-derived fixture

Use the matching source under
[`contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/`](../../contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/).
After editing it, regenerate the declared fixtures:

```sh
python3 scripts/generate/generate-generation-from-spec.py
```

The generator currently owns only the `reference` → `valid.zti` and
`sel4-channel` → `sel4-channel.zti` mappings listed above. It derives
executable, instance, object, binding, budget, and health records from the
system spec plus the component-spec corpus. Review the generated fixture; do
not patch it afterward.

### Path B: directly owned seL4 plane

For a plane not listed in the derivation map, edit its owning
`contracts/generation-manifest/v1/compositions/sel4-*.zti` directly. The default product is
this path: `just run` consumes `sel4.zti` through the product builder.

### Facts every composition must cover

Whether declared directly or derived, verify all applicable facts:

1. **Executable and object:** the executable names the `hello` artifact, role,
   command profile if any, spawn budget, and generation-module object.
2. **Instance placement:** the instance names that executable, its owner,
   autostart policy, dependencies, health classification, and any scheduling or
   thread facts.
3. **Spawner authority:** the actual userspace spawner receives an executable
   grant targeting `hello` with both `exec` and `spawn` rights. A catalogue
   executable without this edge remains inert.
4. **Holder binding:** the executable grant is bound into the spawner's
   capability table. Omit a slot pin when deterministic assignment is enough.
5. **Health membership:** required instances appear in the applicable required
   set; optional instances do not silently inflate the terminal census.
6. **Budgets:** stack, spawn, shared-buffer, mapping, loan, private-memory, and
   other ceilings agree with the component spec and intended behavior.
7. **Optional state:** declare persisted state, schema version, owner, and
   rollback policy only when the component genuinely owns state.
8. **Interfaces and fabric:** add interface schemas, route participants,
   interposition, notifications, QoS, and fabric budgets only for a component
   that participates in those mechanisms.

### Launch policy: ownership is active

The root stages and activates only root-owned autostart instances. Every
owner-spawned instance needs both:

- an executable capability held by its declared owner; and
- an explicit `slime_rt::spawn` call in that owning policy component.

The product graph demonstrates the distinction. Its catalogue contains
`console` and `spawn-service`, but `init` explicitly resolves their executable
bindings and calls `slime_rt::spawn`. Their catalogue and instance records do
not launch themselves. If `hello` is owned by `init`, extend `init`'s owning
boot action and supervision path; if another policy component owns it, that
component must perform the spawn.

Autostart on an owner-spawned instance states composition policy; it does not
turn root into the spawner.

## 4. Add only required authority

Start with no grants. The `hello` example needs none for its own behavior; the
only new authority edge is the executable capability its owner needs to launch
it.

For every additional grant, answer all five questions in the composition and
code review:

1. **Source:** which instance owns or creates the object?
2. **Holder or target:** which instance receives authority, and is that the
   same instance the grant's target names?
3. **Rights:** which exact root-checked operations does the behavior require?
4. **Transferability:** may the holder pass a narrowed copy onward, or must the
   grant remain local?
5. **Binding:** under which declared name does the holder resolve it, and does
   an existing ABI require a particular slot?

Default to the narrowest rights and `transferable = false`. Do not add ambient
authority, broad service access, or an executable grant to a convenient holder
that is not the actual spawner.

Bindings may omit `slot`; the generation builder assigns deterministic slots by
grant name within each holder's namespace. Pin a slot only when preserving an
existing ABI or byte-frozen boot layout. A new component does not justify fixed
numbers by itself. If a frozen layout must move, review and bless the deliberate
boot-layout diff rather than weakening the gate.

See [Components](../concepts/components.md) for the isolation model and
[Capabilities](../concepts/capabilities.md) for grant, spawn-grant, and transfer
semantics.

## 5. Prove behavior under QEMU

A component is complete only when the narrowest owning QEMU gate observes the
whole vertical slice in order:

1. generation admission includes the intended executable, instance, grants,
   objects, and budgets;
2. the root stages it if root-owned, or the owner receives an executable
   binding and the spawn is authorized;
3. the expected instance is staged and activated;
4. the gate observes the exact component marker, such as `[hello] running`;
5. the component exits cleanly, or reaches its intended healthy-idle service
   state;
6. terminal components are reclaimed, including task-owned capabilities; and
7. the final `SLIME_GRAPH HEALTHY` census has the intended required, live,
   completed, and failed counts.

Treat the gate as a contract, not a smoke-print search. Existing checks pin
hard-coded executable, instance, required, and completed counts, plus ordered
markers. Update those values and ordering deliberately when the graph changes.
Never replace an exact assertion with a weaker count, unordered search, or
optional marker merely to recover green output.

## Validation order for a real component addition

These commands describe the **future component implementation workflow**. They
are not evidence required for this documentation-only page.

1. Crate shape and release profile:

   ```sh
   just component_crate_split_check
   ```

2. Component declaration and evidence link:

   ```sh
   just component_spec_check
   ```

3. Only for a system-spec-derived path:

   ```sh
   just system_spec_check
   ```

4. The narrowest owning QEMU gate, for example:

   ```sh
   just sel4_component_graph_check
   ```

   Use the actual owning `just sel4_*_check`, not this example by default.

5. For the permanent Rust addition:

   ```sh
   just fmt_check_all
   just lint_all
   ```

Run `just contracts_check` when a contract surface changed. Run `just
generation_check` when the generation builder or its governed generation
construction surface changed. Do not add either as ritual for an unrelated
crate-only edit.

The finished path is always the same: **crate → component spec → composition →
authority and launch policy → observed QEMU evidence**.
