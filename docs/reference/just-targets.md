# `just` recipe reference

Every public recipe, grouped as the `just/*.just` files group them. This page
exists so that a recipe name you meet in a checker, a work item, or a PR has
one place to be looked up; `just --list` prints the same names, and
`just docs_check` refuses any `just <name>` literal in documentation that no
longer resolves. Private recipes (`_*`) are omitted.

Descriptions are one line each. The authoritative statement of what a gate
proves is its checker's docstring (`scripts/check/check-*.py`) and the
architecture page that lists it under "Verification". Where a recipe's
comment in its `.just` file was the source, improving that comment improves
this table.

Conventions:

- `*_check` boots or verifies and fails closed; `*_gen` regenerates an
  output from its schema; `*_bless` rewrites a frozen fixture from an
  observed run and must be reviewed as a diff; `*_image` builds only.
- Every `sel4_*`, `io_*`, `private_memory_*`, and plane recipe depends on
  `sel4_pin_check` and resolves a system-image closure before building.
- The `compatibility` group is aliases kept for external callers; new
  references use the canonical recipe.

For how the planes work and how to add one, read
[Add a gate](../getting-started/07-add-a-gate.md).

## product

| Recipe | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `just framework_cpu_boot_check` | P6.6 judges a physical Framework CPU boot. |
| `just framework_cpu_boot_prepare device protect` | P6.6: the Framework's removable-media CPU boot, and its evidence. |
| `just framework_cpu_boot_verify *ARGS` | P6.6: re-hash the protected internal region and judge the operator's record; arguments pass through to `check-framework-cpu-boot.py verify`. |
| `just framework_media_check` | P6.5 builds one Framework-target-qualified raw GPT/FAT32 image, validates the identity and removable-writer safety boundary, then boots those exact bytes under the pinned q35/OVMF reference to the resident product graph. |
| `just framework_media_image` | Build P6.5's Framework-qualified deterministic GPT/FAT32 image. |
| `just generation_check` | Build the product seL4 generation twice and verify identical admitted bytes. |
| `just riscv64_qemu_check` | The marker chain this platform's transcript must satisfy. |
| `just riscv64_qemu_image_check` | P3 replays the architecture-neutral corpus on the pinned RV64 reference. |
| `just run` | Build the product image (`sel4_product_image`) and boot it under the pinned QEMU AArch64 machine with serial on stdio; quit with `Ctrl-A x`. |
| `just run_release` | Same as `run`. |
| `just sel4_boot_check` | P5.4.9/C8.10 gate: the full C8 graph in one seL4 generation. |
| `just sel4_boot_layout_bless` | Rewrite the frozen boot-layout fixtures from an observed boot; read the diff first. |

| `just sel4_mavlink_graph_check` | IO9: the product graph plus a serial driver and a MAVLink heartbeat producer, on QEMU where no port exists: the driver binds nothing and stays resident, the producer holds its one-second grid and reports each refusal, and the graph stays healthy. |
| `just sel4_pin_check` | Refuse unless every pinned submodule, toolchain, target spec, and kernel config matches `sel4/pins.toml`; installs nothing. |
| `just sel4_product_image` | Build the product component-graph image `build/slime-sel4-graph.elf`. |
| `just sel4_pwm_graph_check` | IO8: the product graph plus the pwm driver, on QEMU where no PWM block exists: the driver binds nothing, stays resident, and answers Slisp's `(pwm 0 1600)` with no-device while the graph stays healthy. |
| `just sel4_qemu_image_check` | Build the pinned seL4 kernel, root, child fixture, and loader image, writing `build/slime-sel4.identity.json`. |

| `just x86_64_sel4_image_check` | P6.1 builds the admitted x86-64 seL4 kernel, root task, child fixture, and generation for the pinned QEMU pc99 profile, and P6.2 assembles the GRUB Multiboot2 EFI tree that supplies the two ELFs as modules. |
| `just x86_64_sel4_root_boot_check` | P6.2's boot contract and P6.3's native execution slice. |

## component sdk

| Recipe | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `just component_crate_split_check` | Keep allocator groups in separate Cargo invocations: feature unification would enable mutually exclusive global allocators. |
| `just component_sdk_compatibility_check` | CP9: version policy and an evidence-backed compatibility matrix. |

| `just rpi5_serial_monitor serial timeout` | Bring-up aid only: monitor debug UART without qualifying the board. |
| `just sel4_duo_image_check` | One seL4 build platform: the board or machine an image targets. |
| `just sel4_rpi5_image_check` | Uses the board-specific bcm2712 prefix, target directory, generation, image, and pinned hashes; it is not interchangeable with the qemu-arm-virt build. |
