//! Per-region leaf-table ownership, page-backed and nonmoving.
//!
//! A private region records which 2 MiB spans of its window already hold a leaf
//! table, because that decides whether the next page may take a large frame and
//! because a failed growth keeps a table bound to the span it was mapped into.
//! That state used to be an array inside the task record, sized from the
//! compiled target's per-region page count. A policy-derived window is not
//! bounded by that row, so the bits move here: the allocator funds them from
//! the same page-backed metadata every other record lives in, and hands the
//! region a pointer that stays valid for the region's whole life.
//!
//! One record per region rather than a packed run. [`super::segmented`]
//! guarantees a record never moves and never crosses a page, which is what lets
//! a `Copy` region hold a raw pointer at all; a variable-length run would have
//! to guarantee that separately, for a saving of a few hundred bytes per task.
//! The record's width is therefore the addressing limit on a window's spans,
//! and it refuses explicitly rather than truncating.
