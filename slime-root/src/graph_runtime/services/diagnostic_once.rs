//! Once-per-key gating for the root's per-operation diagnostic lines.
//!
//! Every clock request and every payload DMA once printed one serial line.
//! Under QEMU TCG each UART byte is a trapped write on the one CPU, so those
//! lines stalled the whole graph. Each line is now printed the first time its
//! key occurs; later occurrences are counted and reported in one summary
//! before `SLIME_GRAPH served`. Plane checkers test these lines for presence
//! only, so the first occurrence keeps every one of them satisfied.
//!
//! Keys live in fixed tables. When a table is full the line is printed as
//! before, so a key is never hidden: overflow costs volume, not evidence.
