//! admitted ledger, the physical reservations its guarantees were taken into,
//! and the incarnation each subject task is bound to. Nothing here allocates;
//! it decides who may ask, for how much, and against which reservation, and
//! records what actually happened.
//!
//! Ordering is the point. Reservations are materialized before any task is
//! constructed, because a guarantee a later static construction could spend is
//! not a guarantee; a subject binds its incarnation during construction and
//! before publication, so a staged task can neither be dispatched nor grow
//! without one; and a boot that cannot fund every guarantee fails closed
//! before a single component is published.
