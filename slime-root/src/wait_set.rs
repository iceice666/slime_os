//! C9.2 supervision-source delivery.
//!
//! The root owns no wait set: no ready queue, no source registry, no notion of
//! which component is currently blocked. What it owns here is exactly one thing
//! C9.1 already established the shape of — a badged write capability it signals
//! when something a waiter declared an interest in happens.
//!
//! # Why only supervision sources are here
//!
//! Of the six declared source kinds, five are signalled by a peer: a publisher
//! signals its subscriber's ring, a client signals a broker's control edge, and
//! `slime-root/src/notification.rs` already mints those caps from the
//! generation's own `notificationBindings`. A timer is signalled by
//! `crate::clock`, from C9.1's contract data. That leaves peer death, which no
//! peer can signal — the peer is the thing that died. So the root signals it, and
//! this module is that one delivery path rather than a general mechanism.
//!
//! # What a waiter has to already hold
//!
//! A supervision source names one of the waiter's own capability slots, and the
//! root signals the badge only when that slot holds a supervision capability
//! naming the task that just ended. So death delivery reaches exactly the
//! components the generation already gave a supervision handle: the badge adds
//! no authority, only a wake for authority a component already has. A waiter
//! whose slot holds nothing, or a handle naming a different task, is not
//! signalled — that is not a missed wake but a peer it was never supervising.
