//! Serialized root diagnostic records.
//!
//! The root task's service loop and its console dispatcher are separate threads
//! at the same priority, and the kernel prints one byte per syscall, so a record
//! must be emitted entirely while its producer owns the output. Ownership is a
//! FIFO ticket: a waiter yields to the runnable owner instead of spinning, and a
//! producer that has just finished cannot overtake one already waiting.
//!
//! The waiting rule relies on every producer being a root thread at that same
//! priority on a single non-MCS core, where `seL4_Yield` queues the caller behind
//! the owner; a lower-priority owner would never be scheduled by a yield.
//!
//! A record is validated, and a formatted record fully rendered into a bounded
//! buffer, before a ticket is taken. A refused record therefore emits nothing,
//! and an owner never formats, allocates, or blocks while it holds the output.
//! Nothing called while holding the output may itself produce a record.
