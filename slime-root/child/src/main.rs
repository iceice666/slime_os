//! Native seL4 child fixture proving the `slime-root` mechanism cutover.
//!
//! The root task builds this image into its own CSpace/VSpace/TCB and grants it
//! exactly one authority it can invoke: the badged root service endpoint in
//! CSpace slot 1. The fixture sends one root service request, then follows the
//! directive the root returns — exit cleanly, or fault deliberately so the root
//! observes a fault on its supervision path.
//!
//! The clean-exit fixture additionally runs the shared-buffer phase before it
//! exits. That phase is the observable half of `slime-root/src/buffer_adapter.rs`:
//! it reads bytes the root wrote through a real shared frame, writes a reply
//! into the same frame, and then deliberately violates the two protections the
//! root's mapping rights are supposed to enforce by mechanism —
//!
//! 1. storing to a read-only mapping, and
//! 2. executing from a data page mapped `EXECUTE_NEVER`.
//!
//! Both must raise an attributable VM fault. The root supervises each one,
//! moves this thread's PC past it, and resumes, so the fixture still reaches
//! its ordinary clean exit. A probe that does *not* fault is a protection
//! failure, and the fixture says so loudly rather than continuing quietly.
//!
//! Slot numbers and operation labels here mirror `slime-root/src/task.rs` and
//! `slime-root/src/ipc.rs`. Nothing is discovered at runtime: a fixture that
//! could search for authority would not prove the grant is what conveys it.
