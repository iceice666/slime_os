/// endpoint minted after activation has no object to name, so the plan would
/// otherwise have to either omit it — leaving the child's slot unaccounted —
/// or degrade the grant to a bare rights assertion.
///
/// What this record fixes before activation: the minter, the holder, the
/// destination slot, and an exact rights ceiling. A spawn is refused unless
/// the caller *is* the declared minter, the destination is the declared slot
/// rather than one the caller chose, and the transferred rights fall within
/// both the ceiling and what the caller itself holds.
///
/// What it deliberately does **not** fix is object identity, which does not
/// exist until the minter creates it. A minter can therefore satisfy a minted
/// declaration with a capability of the right kind and rights but a different
/// underlying object — a supervision handle naming another of its children, or
/// a directory capability at a broader scope than intended. The declaration
/// bounds *who may hand what class of authority to whom, and where it lands*;
/// it is not an object binding. A relationship that must pin identity needs a
/// [`Grant`] against a concrete object instead.
///
/// `transferable` is folded into [`Self::rights`] as `RIGHT_TRANSFER` rather
/// than carried as a separate field, so the two cannot disagree — unlike
/// [`Grant`], whose separate flag must be checked for coherence against its
/// rights word.
