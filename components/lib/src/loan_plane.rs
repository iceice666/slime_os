//! across 21 planes in one 2286-line binary, so every plane's edit shared a file
//! with every other plane's. This module holds the loan plane and the helpers
//! only it uses; `console_send_slot`, `wait_clean`, and the other genuinely
//! cross-plane helpers stay in `init.rs` and are passed or re-exported.
//!
//! `#[path]`-included rather than a crate module because each `src/bin/*.rs` is
//! its own `no_std`/`no_main` target, which is the same mechanism
//! `fabric_call_scenario.rs` and `launch_context.rs` already use.
