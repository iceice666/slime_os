# Native development, live update, and on-device build track

**Purpose:** Let a user author source inside Slime OS, compile a native program directly into the admitted component-image format, execute it without rebooting under explicit development authority, turn tested artifacts into release-authorized generations, switch compatible userspace components at runtime, and eventually reproduce a complete generation on-device.

**Status:** Not started.

**Decision:** Slisp is both the interactive language and the first non-Rust application language. Zutai remains Slime's only schema/configuration language. Slisp owns syntax, evaluator/compiler behavior, and its standard library; Slime owns executable-image, target, syscall, capability, build, admission, generation, activation, and verification contracts.

**Source directions:** [direction 3](../docs/directions/03-nondeterminism-as-capabilities.md), [direction 23](../docs/directions/23-build-provenance.md), and [direction 30](../docs/directions/30-deterministic-on-device-builds.md).

**Dependencies:** M5's content-addressed object store, deterministic generations, state policies, release authorization, health promotion, and rollback; M6's directory, spawn, generation-management, input, and transfer mechanisms; Slisp's verified non-Rust component path; [P0](07-architecture-portability.md#p0-architecture-target-and-executable-artifact-contracts); and [C9](02-core-runtime.md#c9-robot-runtime-authority) for explicit time and lifecycle control.

## Boundaries

- **Zutai remains the only schema language.** Every project/build/admission/update message or persistent format is a versioned Zutai schema under `contracts/` with generated bindings. The new language may import generated protocol bindings; it does not define a second wire, manifest, build-request, or persistence schema language.
- **There is one native executable format.** A compiler may emit the P0-admitted `SLIMECME` component-image revision — the ELF-carrying revision `boot-contracts/src/component_image.rs` validates — directly instead of going through the workspace build, but direct output receives no alternate loader, relaxed validation, or language-specific admission path. The retired `SLIMECMP` (component/v1) revision is refused, not a target.
- **Images contain mapping, not authority.** Source annotations and compiler output cannot declare capabilities, grants, command-profile membership, release authorization, resource accounts, or activation policy. Those remain generation/admission inputs enforced outside the image.
- **Writing bytes never grants execution.** A file or object that decodes as a component image is still data until an explicitly authorized admission service creates an `Executable` capability. Spawn continues to require `EXEC | SPAWN` and narrow-only grants.
- **Build, test, install, and switch are separate transitions.** An unsigned local artifact may be admitted only to a bounded ephemeral development session. A persistent boot or live-generation activation still requires the existing release authorization and generation closure checks.
- **No writable-executable path.** D1–D7 add neither JIT authority nor a dynamic linker. Compilation finishes into a sealed immutable image before admission; mapped tasks retain W^X and the normal component-image bounds.
- **No ambient development environment.** Source roots, toolchains, standard libraries, target profiles, parameters, diagnostics, scratch space, clocks, entropy, network destinations, and output stores are explicit capabilities or content identities. A missing input fails rather than falling back to a host path, global package index, inherited environment, or network download.
- **Provenance and authorization stay distinct.** Build provenance answers how bytes were produced. M5.8 release metadata answers whether those bytes may become a persistent or live-active generation. Neither substitutes for the other.
- **Live activation is side-by-side, never in-place mutation.** A replacement component starts with fresh mappings and capabilities; a bounded readiness/cutover transaction moves traffic only after health succeeds, then retires the old instance.
- **The first live-update class is intentionally narrow.** D5 admits only generations with the same target, kernel, bootstrap, component graph, interface identities, grants, state bindings, resource budgets, and scheduling classes. Kernel/bootstrap/ABI changes, state-schema changes, grant or graph changes, and exclusive-device authority changes are reboot-required until separately modeled.

## Ownership contract for the new language

The language project owns:

- grammar, parser, type/effect system, compiler implementation, language package rules, and standard-library source;
- deterministic lowering from a normalized source/toolchain closure to one exact P0 target profile;
- direct emission of the admitted `SLIMECME` revision, plus detached diagnostics/debug data when requested;
- a pinned compiler/toolchain identity consumable by host and Slime build services.

Slime OS owns:

- the `SLIMECME` component-image, root-operation, target-profile, capability, and generated IPC binding contracts;
- validation, content identity, storage, executable admission, spawn, supervision, and resource accounting;
- generation construction, authority diff/classification, release authorization, live/boot activation, health, and rollback;
- conformance fixtures proving that a producer cannot bypass target, ABI, W^X, bounds, or authority rules.

The producer boundary is therefore neutral:

```text
normalized source closure
+ exact compiler/toolchain identity
+ exact target/profile and build parameters
    -> compiler
    -> SLIMECME bytes + diagnostics/debug objects
    -> Slime structural validation and content identity
    -> ephemeral admission OR generation construction
```

## Sequencing

1. D1 begins from completed M6 storage/directory mechanisms and the resident Slisp REPL. D2 extends the already producer-neutral external-artifact path into a direct Slisp image backend.
2. D3 composes D1 and D2 with C9 time/lifecycle authority and the existing per-spawner/per-holder resource accounting into a hermetic on-device build service.
3. D4 consumes D3 output through a new bounded executable-admission mechanism and closes the first edit → compile → run loop without changing BootState.
4. D5 is an independent C8/C9 lifecycle slice over signed generations; it introduces the narrow, transactional live-update class and deterministic reboot-required classification.
5. D6 composes D4 and D5 with M6 generation management: local artifacts are tested ephemerally, authorized externally, then either switched live or selected for next boot.
6. D7 reproduces the reference mixed-language generation on-device. Because the current tree is Rust, its first complete-system gate consumes X1 for a confined pinned Rust toolchain unless a native Rust compiler route proves the same contract first.

## D1 — In-system source workspace and script loop

**Status:** Not started.

**Depends on:** M6.3 directory capabilities, the spawn service, and the resident Slisp REPL.

### Deliverables

- define a bounded versioned Zutai source-workspace/project contract naming language identity, source entries, toolchain identity, exact target profile, entry unit, normalized build parameters, and output kind without host paths or inherited environment;
- add a minimal native editor capable of creating, editing, saving, reopening, and atomically replacing bounded UTF-8 source files under one explicitly granted project directory;
- extend Slisp with bounded project/source functions and stored program execution under explicit directory, stream, environment, and service grants; these are ordinary Lisp functions, not reader syntax;
- preserve source roots as immutable directory snapshots with explicit commit, so interrupted saves retain the prior readable root and build inputs name one exact snapshot;
- define generated structured diagnostic/source-span bindings for editor and later compiler use; diagnostics are bounded data, not unstructured access to a terminal or filesystem.

### Required checks

- an editor without the project `Directory` capability cannot enumerate, read, modify, or infer another namespace;
- oversized files, invalid UTF-8 where text is required, excessive entries/depth, stale roots, and interrupted saves fail before replacing the prior root;
- reopening a committed project returns byte-identical source and normalized project metadata;
- a stored Slisp program launches only commands in its granted profile, cannot acquire an undeclared cwd/stream/environment/capability, and leaves source data intact after parse or child failure.

### Planned verification target

```sh
just authoring_check
```

### Exit condition

Inside QEMU, a user creates a project, edits and commits source, reopens the identical snapshot, and runs a stored Slisp program; an ungranted editor/program cannot observe or modify another directory or launch a command outside its profile.

## D2 — Producer-neutral image contract and direct language backend

**Status:** Not started.

**Depends on:** D1's normalized project identity and P0's exact architecture/ABI/page-profile executable-artifact contract. The language compiler may initially run on the development host, but its emitted image is the same object later consumed on-device.

### Deliverables

- make P0's component-image conformance producer-neutral: the existing workspace ELF build path and a direct image emitter both target the same versioned `SLIMECME` schema and the identical `boot-contracts` validator;
- pin the new language compiler, standard library, generated Slime syscall/IPC bindings, optimization profile, and backend parameters as one content-addressed toolchain closure;
- implement a deterministic backend that emits the exact target-qualified component image directly, including entry, stack requirement, bounded segments, zero-fill, and per-segment R/W/X flags, with no relocation, dynamic-link, authority, signature, or ambient-runtime metadata;
- keep source maps, symbols, compiler diagnostics, and build provenance in detached bounded objects unread by the loader in `slime-root/src/child_vspace.rs`; changing or omitting them cannot change executable semantics accidentally;
- publish language-owned conformance fixtures for a returning component, a typed-IPC client/server pair, a faulting component, and malformed output classes; Slime owns the acceptance oracle and target mismatch corpus;
- keep every cross-component protocol in Zutai-generated bindings. Language-native data layouts are in-memory only unless backed by a versioned Zutai contract.

### Required checks

- two clean builds with identical normalized source, toolchain, target, and parameters emit byte-identical component images and object identities;
- changing source, compiler identity, target, ABI, page profile, or normalized parameter changes the build key and cannot reuse a stale image;
- unknown image revisions, target/ABI mismatch, invalid entry/stack/segments, overlap, overflow, W+X, and over-bound output are rejected by the same corpus regardless of producer;
- a direct-emitted component boots in an ordinary generation and performs typed IPC under only its declared grants; it receives no authority from source annotations or image contents;
- no ELF-beyond-the-admitted-revision parsing, language runtime, type metadata, or compiler-specific policy enters `slime-root`, and none enters seL4;

### Planned verification target

```sh
just language_image_check
```

### Exit condition

A pinned compiler for the new language directly emits a byte-deterministic target-qualified `SLIMECME` component that runs in the ordinary QEMU graph through generated Zutai IPC bindings, while every malformed, mismatched, widened-authority, and nondeterministic fixture fails at its owning boundary.

## D3 — Hermetic on-device build service and provenance

**Status:** Not started.

**Depends on:** D1–D2, [C9.1](02-core-runtime.md#c91--explicit-clock-and-timer-service-authority)'s explicit time and [C9.4](02-core-runtime.md#c94--lifecycle-transitions-and-supervised-restart)'s lifecycle authority, M5.4 object storage, and M5.8's separation of release authorization. This milestone absorbs the build-relevant mechanism from directions 3, 23, and 30. It does not depend on a conserved CPU account: see the track dependencies above.

### Deliverables

- define versioned Zutai build-request, build-result, diagnostic, and detached build-provenance schemas naming the exact source snapshot, toolchain closure, target, parameters, resource account, output identities, and builder identity;
- run the compiler as a bounded component whose only inputs are content-addressed source/toolchain objects and normalized request data, whose scratch/output directories are explicit capabilities, and whose successful outputs become sealed immutable objects;
- complete the deterministic-component authority rule: C9 Clock authority and an object-specific Entropy authority are explicit; a manifest-declared deterministic builder receives neither real source and cannot receive one later through capability transfer; a seeded fixture is a distinct declared input rather than ambient randomness;
- charge memory, task count, shared-buffer pages, private-memory pages, scratch bytes, output bytes, diagnostic bytes, and child count to a manifest-declared build account, with structured exhaustion and full cleanup on exit, fault, timeout, cancellation, or supervisor restart. CPU is bounded as elapsed wall-clock time against a declared deadline rather than as a conserved account, because the pinned kernel is built `KernelIsMCS OFF` and has no budget to charge;
- key caching on the entire normalized input closure, never a mutable path or timestamp; validate a cached object's digest and producer contract before reuse;
- emit detached provenance binding source, toolchain, target, parameters, builder identity, and outputs. The immutable selector does not parse provenance, and provenance never grants release authorization;
- support the new language compiler as the first native build component while keeping the request/result protocol language-neutral for later Rust or other admitted toolchains.

### Required checks

- the host and Slime build services compile the same fixture from the same normalized closure to the same component-image identity;
- attempts to read wall time, draw undeclared entropy, fetch a package, inspect an ambient directory/environment, or receive a prohibited nondeterminism capability fail structurally;
- each resource class exhausts at its declared bound without committing a partial output or disturbing another build account;
- changing any provenance field or output identity fails verification, while release authorization remains independently required;
- cache hits reproduce validated identities and cache misses cannot alias after source, toolchain, target, or parameter changes;
- compiler crash, malformed output, cancellation, and supervisor restart reclaim scratch space, buffers, children, and account charges.

### Planned verification target

```sh
just hermetic_build_check
```

### Exit condition

A native build service inside QEMU consumes one content-addressed source/toolchain closure and emits the same sealed component identity as the host build, with enforceable absence of ambient nondeterminism/authority, bounded resource use, and independently verifiable provenance.

## D4 — Ephemeral executable admission and sandboxed run

**Status:** Not started.

**Depends on:** D3, M6 spawn/supervision, and [C9.4](02-core-runtime.md#c94--lifecycle-transitions-and-supervised-restart)'s lifecycle transitions. The session's resource bounds are the existing per-supervision-subtree limits this milestone declares below, not a conserved CPU account.

### Deliverables

- define a versioned Zutai executable-admission protocol and add a distinct `ExecutableFactory`/`EXECUTABLE_ADMIT` authority; update the capability matrix in the same change as the root operation and service gate that serve it;
- admit only a sealed content-identified component object through bounded transfer, recompute identity, re-run the P0/component decoder, and create an immutable root-tracked `Executable` record only after all checks pass;
- impose fixed root-wide and per-supervision-subtree limits for admitted image bytes, executable objects, mappings, tasks, and lifetime; admission policy, not source/image data, supplies the child's spawn budget and resource account, defaulting to no children and no external grants;
- return the admitted executable only to a development-run service. It spawns the child with an explicit user-selected grant set, fresh endpoints/mappings, separate stdout/stderr/diagnostics, and a supervision handle;
- permit unsigned local images only on this ephemeral path. They cannot enter a command profile, BootState, known-good/pending roots, or persistent generation without D6's release-authorized transition;
- terminate and reclaim the entire development session on completion, cancellation, timeout, compiler/run-service fault, or explicit lifecycle action; stale executable handles and backing bytes become unusable;
- preserve W^X and immutable code. Admission does not add JIT, dynamic loading, self-modifying code, or executable mappings derived from ordinary writable buffers.

### Required checks

- a component without `EXECUTABLE_ADMIT` cannot turn file, store, or shared-buffer bytes into an executable capability;
- malformed, mismatched, over-bound, hash-inconsistent, writable-executable, or changed-after-seal images fail before an executable object or task exists;
- a valid image receives exactly the selected grants, cannot inherit builder/editor/run-service authority, and cannot spawn children unless admission policy explicitly budgets and grants it;
- an infinite loop can be bounded and terminated; exit, fault, timeout, cancellation, and run-service loss remain distinct and reclaim all executable/image/task/account state;
- an unsigned admitted image runs ephemerally but select/boot/live-activation paths reject it without valid release metadata;
- an unrelated component and development session remain live when the test program or compiler faults.

### Planned verification target

```sh
just dev_exec_check
```

### Exit condition

Within one QEMU boot, a user edits new-language source, compiles it on-device, admits the sealed image, and runs it under a selected minimal capability set; malformed or unauthorized code never becomes executable, and session teardown reclaims every code and authority object without changing the active generation.

## D5 — Transactional live component cutover

**Status:** Not started.

**Depends on:** C8 typed route/interposition services, C9 lifecycle/health/restart authority, M5.6 checked state/rollback semantics, M5.8 release authorization, and M6.5 generation management.

### Deliverables

- define versioned Zutai runtime-generation diff, compatibility classification, cutover plan, readiness, drain, commit, abort, and observation schemas; policy stays in a userspace lifecycle/update service;
- deterministically classify a signed staged generation as `live-compatible` or `reboot-required` before spawning anything. The first live class requires identical target, kernel, bootstrap, component graph, interface identities, grants, state bindings, resource budgets, and scheduling classes; only selected executable identities and explicitly admitted non-authority parameters may differ;
- treat kernel/bootstrap/ABI changes, graph or grant changes, state-schema/policy changes, interface identity changes, resource/scheduling changes, and exclusive device-authority changes as reboot-required with a structured reason, never a best-effort live attempt;
- compute the affected component closure and start replacements side-by-side with fresh endpoints, buffers, timers, mappings, device handles, supervision, and resource accounts; source components cannot retain or transfer stale authority into replacements;
- route long-lived services through C8/interposition endpoints, perform bounded readiness and in-flight drain, atomically commit route ownership, and terminate the old closure only after the new closure is healthy;
- keep the old closure and routes authoritative until commit. Any pre-commit fault/timeout/cancellation aborts the replacement and leaves unrelated components and the old service live; post-commit health failure follows a bounded reverse cutover while the old closure is retained;
- persist the new generation as ordinary pending BootState before live cutover, but do not promote it to known-good solely from a live userspace switch. The next boot still exercises immutable selector/root pending admission and health before M5.6 promotion; power loss at any live-cutover boundary boots either verified known-good or the intact pending generation, never a persisted hybrid graph;
- report booted-generation identity, live userspace-generation identity, cutover state, and pending/known-good status distinctly so an observer cannot mistake a live-qualified graph for a boot-qualified generation.

### Required checks

- a signed generation changing one compatible service executable switches requests to the new instance without rebooting while an unrelated service retains task identity and uninterrupted traffic;
- injected decode, spawn, readiness, drain, commit, old-service-exit, reverse-cutover, and update-service faults produce one bounded old-or-new routing result with no duplicated authority or persisted hybrid graph;
- stale endpoints, buffers, timers, mappings, supervision handles, and device capabilities from the old instance fail after commit and all associated resource charges are reclaimed;
- every excluded difference is classified reboot-required before replacement spawn, and removing an authority edge can never create reachability;
- unsigned or closure-invalid generations fail before BootState or runtime graph changes;
- after a successful live switch, reboot still treats the generation as pending and promotes it only through the ordinary boot health path; a failing pending boot returns to the prior known-good generation.

### Planned verification target

```sh
just live_update_check
```

### Exit condition

A release-authorized generation differing only in one live-compatible component switches that service in QEMU without reboot or unrelated-task restart, preserves old service on every pre-commit failure, reverses a bounded post-commit failure, rejects every reboot-required diff before spawn, and still requires an ordinary pending boot before known-good promotion.

## D6 — On-device generation construction and authorized activation

**Status:** Not started.

**Depends on:** D4–D5 and completed M5/M6 generation, transfer, release, state, health, and rollback mechanisms.

### Deliverables

- run a userspace generation builder over normalized Zutai system intent and sealed component/resource objects, producing the same bounded canonical generation, closure, object identities, target binding, state policies, grants, health policy, and detached release subject as the host builder;
- expose Slisp build, inspect, test, authority-diff, stage, live-switch, next-boot select, and rollback functions through explicit service capabilities rather than global commands with ambient boot/store authority;
- keep ephemeral test and installation distinct: D4 may test an unsigned image, but D5 live switch and M6 next-boot selection require a complete M5.8-authorized release; no developer mode silently weakens immutable selector/root admission;
- make the initial local authorization workflow import valid detached release metadata for the exact generation identity. On-device private-key custody is not introduced here and may later consume A2/A4 without blocking deterministic local builds;
- select D5 only when its exact compatibility classifier accepts the generation; otherwise report reboot-required and use the ordinary pending-attempt path without mutating the running graph;
- store and transfer only content identities missing from the destination closure, preserving state policies and source/toolchain/build-provenance objects only when the generation declares them retained;
- present normalized component, object, authority, state, resource, target, and activation differences before the caller exercises the separately granted update capability.

### Required checks

- an on-device and host build from the same normalized system/object closure produce byte-identical generation bytes and identity;
- an unsigned or wrong-target/wrong-parent/stale-sequence/incomplete-closure result remains inspectable as data but cannot change BootState or the live graph;
- importing valid release metadata for the exact identity allows staging; altered metadata or any post-signing object/authority change fails before activation;
- a one-component live-compatible update uses D5, while a kernel, ABI, graph, grant, state-schema, resource, or exclusive-device change is deterministically routed to next-boot activation;
- next-boot failure consumes attempts and returns to known-good with declared state policy; live failure retains or restores the old route as D5 specifies;
- unchanged objects are not recopied, and no ungranted block device or directory is modified.

### Planned verification target

```sh
just on_device_generation_check
```

### Exit condition

Inside Slime, a user builds and ephemerally tests a changed component, constructs the byte-identical canonical generation, imports authorization for that exact identity, observes its full diff, and activates it through either the proven live-compatible path or the ordinary pending-boot path; every invalid or unauthorized result remains inert data.

## D7 — Independent full-generation reproduction

**Status:** Not started.

**Depends on:** D6 and one D3-conforming on-device toolchain route for every language in the reference generation. The initial current-tree route uses X1 for a pinned confined Rust compiler/linker unless a native Rust toolchain independently passes the same contract; the new language continues to use its direct native image backend.

### Deliverables

- represent the complete reference system source, generated Zutai bindings, Rust and new-language toolchains, link/image producers, build parameters, kernel/bootstrap/components, resources, and generation builder as one content-addressed normalized build closure;
- execute every step under D3 build accounts with no ambient source, package index, network, clock, entropy, host filesystem, or inherited environment; an X1 toolchain personality receives only the exact project/toolchain/scratch/output capabilities;
- rebuild from a clean object-store namespace and compare every kernel, component, resource, manifest, authority view, provenance subject, and final generation identity with the host build;
- retain detached provenance sufficient to answer which source/toolchain closure produced each object and to locate all generations affected by a changed compiler or dependency digest;
- prove cache correctness by rebuilding unchanged inputs without output mutation and by changing one source/toolchain input so exactly the reachable product closure changes;
- keep compiler bootstrapping separate from this exit condition: the pinned compiler may be an input object. A future compiler-self-host gate must name its bootstrap chain explicitly rather than relabeling on-device execution as source bootstrap.

### Required checks

- two clean host builds and one clean on-device build of the same normalized closure produce byte-identical object and generation identities;
- changing one source, generated binding, compiler, linker, target, or parameter changes the expected reachable outputs and never reuses a stale cache entry;
- a missing dependency, undeclared filesystem/network/time/entropy access, resource exhaustion, compiler fault, or malformed producer output fails without publishing a partial generation;
- provenance identifies every input/output edge and rejects altered builder, dependency, parameter, or subject identity while remaining distinct from release authorization;
- an authorized reproduced generation stages and follows the same live-compatible or pending-boot classification and rollback path as a host-built generation.

### Planned verification target

```sh
just self_host_check
```

### Exit condition

A clean Slime build environment reproduces the complete reference generation byte-for-byte from the same normalized mixed-language source/toolchain closure as the host, with bounded hermetic execution and verifiable provenance; the resulting generation is admitted or rejected solely by ordinary artifact, release, authority, activation, health, and rollback contracts, not by where it was built.

## Track verification stack

Each milestone runs its narrowest target. Any new or changed serialized format runs `just contracts_check`; component/generation changes run `just generation_check`; kernel/component Rust changes run the repository format and lint gates. D4 and D5 additionally retain the full isolation, spawn, wait/wake, shared-buffer, rollback, and framework-safety corpus.

Planned track targets:

```sh
just authoring_check
just language_image_check
just hermetic_build_check
just dev_exec_check
just live_update_check
just on_device_generation_check
just self_host_check
```

No D milestone claims a physical Framework development environment from QEMU evidence. Physical promotion additionally requires the owning storage, input, display, network, IOMMU, suspend/resume, and internal-write safety gates; until then on-device build/write scenarios use disposable QEMU or explicitly replaceable external storage.
